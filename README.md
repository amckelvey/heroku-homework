# heroku-homework

## note-taker-app

```
The purpose of this app is test our knowledge of using express.js and heroku deployments.
```

#### How it works:

```
When opening the app you are presented with a homepage and a link that takes you to the notes.html page.

These are served up to you via express routes as opposed to simple href tags.

The app then uses the fs package of node to read, write, and delete notes to/from a db.json file
```

#### Deployment Links:

[heroku](https://pure-cove-66933.herokuapp.com/)

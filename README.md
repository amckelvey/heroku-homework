#### How it works:

```
When opening the app you are presented with a homepage and a link that takes you to the notes.html page.

These are served up to you via express routes as opposed to simple href tags.

The app then uses the fs package of node to read, write, and delete notes to/from a db.json file
```

#### Deployment Links:

[heroku](https://pure-cove-66933.herokuapp.com/)

#### How to run locally:

```
open terminal in heroku-homework root directory
Command: 'npm i' to install dependencies
Command: 'node server' to have the server run on localhost:3001
```
